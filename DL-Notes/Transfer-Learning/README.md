## 2. Transfer Learning in CNNs
Transfer learning is a technique where a pre-trained model, trained on a large dataset, is adapted to a different but related task. It reduces training time, requires less data, and improves accuracy.

### Benefits of Transfer Learning
✅ Faster training (avoids training from scratch).  
✅ Works well with small datasets.  
✅ Improves model performance by leveraging pre-learned features.  
✅ Reduces computation cost.  

❌ Might not work for very different datasets.  
❌ Fine-tuning requires careful learning rate tuning.  
❌ Large pre-trained models require high memory (GPU recommended).  

### Types of Transfer Learning
#### A. Feature Extraction
- Uses a pre-trained CNN as a feature extractor by removing the fully connected layers.
- The extracted features are passed through a new classifier.

**Example:**
- Take a pre-trained VGG16 or ResNet, remove the top layer, and add a new classifier for the new task.

**When to Use?**
- When the dataset is small.
- When the new task is similar to the original dataset.

#### B. Fine-Tuning
- Some layers of the pre-trained CNN are "unfrozen" and retrained along with the new classifier.
- A lower learning rate is used to adjust existing weights.

**When to Use?**
- When the new dataset is large enough.
- When the new dataset is significantly different from the original dataset.

### Steps for Applying Transfer Learning
#### Step 1: Choose a Pre-Trained Model
Popular pre-trained models include:
- **VGG16/VGG19** - Simple architecture, deep layers.
- **ResNet** - Good for deep networks.
- **Inception** - Efficient and accurate.
- **MobileNet** - Optimized for mobile and embedded systems.
- **EfficientNet** - Balances efficiency and accuracy.

#### Step 2: Load the Pre-Trained Model
```python
from tensorflow.keras.applications import VGG16

base_model = VGG16(weights='imagenet', include_top=False, input_shape=(224, 224, 3))
```
- `weights='imagenet'`: Uses pre-trained ImageNet weights.
- `include_top=False`: Removes the fully connected layers.
- `input_shape=(224, 224, 3)`: Defines input image size.

#### Step 3: Feature Extraction (Freeze Pre-Trained Layers)
```python
for layer in base_model.layers:
    layer.trainable = False  # Freeze the layers
```

#### Step 4: Add a New Classifier
```python
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Flatten, Dense, Dropout
from tensorflow.keras.models import Sequential

model = Sequential([
    base_model,
    Flatten(),
    Dense(256, activation='relu'),
    Dropout(0.5),
    Dense(10, activation='softmax')
])
```

#### Step 5: Compile and Train the Model
```python
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='categorical_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])
model.fit(train_data, validation_data=val_data, epochs=10)
```

#### Step 6: Fine-Tuning (Optional)
```python
for layer in base_model.layers[-10:]:  # Unfreeze last 10 layers
    layer.trainable = True

from tensorflow.keras.optimizers import Adam
model.compile(optimizer=Adam(learning_rate=0.0001), loss='categorical_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])
model.fit(train_data, validation_data=val_data, epochs=5)
```
