## 2. ***Types of Transfer Learning***

## **A. Feature Extraction**

Feature extraction is a transfer learning technique where a pre-trained convolutional neural network (CNN) is used as a feature extractor.  

The primary convolutional layers, responsible for learning spatial hierarchies of features (such as edges, textures, and object parts), remain unchanged.   

However, the fully connected layers at the top are removed and replaced with a new classifier that is specific to the new task.

## **Key Aspects of Feature Extraction**:

- The pre-trained CNN is used without its original fully connected layers.

- Extracted features serve as input to a new classifier tailored to the new task.

- Works well when the new dataset is small and has similarities to the dataset used to train the pre-trained model.

- Reduces training time and computational cost significantly.

### *Example*:

Using a pre-trained VGG16 or ResNet, removing the top layer, and adding a custom classifier for the new task.


## *When to Use?*

- If the new dataset is small.

- When the new task is similar to the original dataset used for training the pre-trained model.



## ***B. Fine-Tuning***

Fine-tuning is a more advanced approach to transfer learning where selected layers of a pre-trained model are "unfrozen" and retrained along with the new classifier.  

This method allows the model to adapt the learned features to the new dataset while preserving general knowledge from the original dataset.


### **Key Aspects of Fine-Tuning**:

- Some of the pre-trained CNN layers are unfrozen and updated during training.

- A lower learning rate is used to fine-tune the model’s existing weights while avoiding large updates that might distort previously learned features.

- Fine-tuning is more computationally expensive than feature extraction but results in higher accuracy when the new dataset is large and differs significantly from the original dataset.

- Requires careful selection of layers to unfreeze—typically, the deeper layers of the CNN are fine-tuned since they capture more abstract, task-specific features.


### *When to Use?*

- If the new dataset is large enough to support additional training.

- If the new dataset differs significantly from the dataset used to train the pre-trained model.

- When maximum accuracy is needed and computational resources allow for extended training.

## **3. Steps for Applying Transfer Learning**

### **Step 1: Load a Pre-Trained Model**
```python
from tensorflow.keras.applications import VGG16

base_model = VGG16(weights='imagenet', include_top=False, input_shape=(224, 224, 3))

    Flatten(),
    Dense(256, activation='relu'),
    Dropout(0.5),
    Dense(10, activation='softmax')
])
```


### **Step 4: Compile and Train the Model**
```python
from tensorflow.keras.optimizers import Adam

model.compile(optimizer=Adam(learning_rate=0.0001), loss='categorical_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])
model.fit(train_data, validation_data=val_data, epochs=10)
