- Works well with small datasets.  

- Improves model performance by leveraging pre-learned features.  

- Reduces computation cost.

## *Cons*  

- Might not work for very different datasets.  

- Fine-tuning requires careful learning rate tuning.  

- Large pre-trained models require high memory (GPU recommended).

## **2. Types of Transfer Learning**

### **A. Feature Extraction**
- Uses a pre-trained CNN as a feature extractor by removing the fully connected layers.
  
- The extracted features are passed through a new classifier.

### **B. Fine-Tuning**
- Some layers of the pre-trained CNN are "unfrozen" and retrained along with the new classifier.
  
- A lower learning rate is used to adjust existing weights.

## **3. Steps for Applying Transfer Learning**

### **Step 1: Load a Pre-Trained Model**
```python
from tensorflow.keras.applications import VGG16

base_model = VGG16(weights='imagenet', include_top=False, input_shape=(224, 224, 3))
```

### **Step 2: Freeze Pre-Trained Layers**
```python
for layer in base_model.layers:
    layer.trainable = False
```

### **Step 3: Add a Custom Classifier**
```python
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Flatten, Dense, Dropout
from tensorflow.keras.models import Sequential

model = Sequential([
    base_model,
    Flatten(),
    Dense(256, activation='relu'),
    Dropout(0.5),
    Dense(10, activation='softmax')
])
```

### **Step 4: Compile and Train the Model**
```python
from tensorflow.keras.optimizers import Adam

model.compile(optimizer=Adam(learning_rate=0.0001), loss='categorical_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])
model.fit(train_data, validation_data=val_data, epochs=10)
```
