## 6. Neural Network Node (Neuron)

### Purpose:
A node (neuron) is a fundamental unit in a neural network that processes input and passes it forward.
Each node in a Dense layer receives input from all nodes of the previous layer.
Each node applies a weight, bias, and an activation function to compute an output.

### Mathematical Representation:
For each neuron:
\[ y = \text{activation}(W \cdot X + b) \]

Where:
- \( X \) = Input from the previous layer
- \( W \) = Weights (learnable parameters)
- \( b \) = Bias
- \( \text{activation} \) = Activation function (e.g., ReLU, Sigmoid, Softmax)
- \( y \) = Output value

## Deep Learning Layers
### 1. Convolutional Layer
A Convolutional Layer (Conv Layer) is the core building block of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). It is responsible for detecting features such as edges, textures, shapes, and patterns in an image. The Convolutional Layer applies a small filter (kernel) to an input image or feature map to extract important features.

#### Steps in a Convolutional Layer:
1. **Kernel (Filter) Application** – A small matrix (e.g., 3×3 or 5×5) slides over the input image.
2. **Element-wise Multiplication** – Each filter value is multiplied with corresponding pixel values.
3. **Summation** – The results are summed to get a single value for that region.
4. **Feature Map Generation** – The process repeats across the image, creating a new feature map.

#### Important Parameters in a Convolutional Layer:
- **Kernel Size** (e.g., 3×3 or 5×5) – Defines the size of the filter.
- **Stride** – Controls how much the filter moves:
  - A stride of 1 moves pixel by pixel.
  - A stride of 2 skips every other pixel.
- **Padding** – Helps maintain the input size by adding zeros around the edges:
  - **Valid Padding**: No padding (output size shrinks).
  - **Same Padding**: Adds zeros so the output size matches the input size.


# Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) - Pooling & Activation Layers

## Pooling Layer
A Pooling Layer is an essential component of CNNs used to reduce the spatial dimensions (height and width) of feature maps while retaining important features. It enhances computational efficiency and reduces the risk of overfitting.

### Benefits of Pooling:
- **Reduces Dimensionality** → Decreases feature map size, leading to faster computations.
- **Extracts Dominant Features** → Keeps the most significant information while removing less important details.
- **Improves Model Generalization** → Prevents overfitting by reducing complexity.
- **Makes CNNs More Translation Invariant** → Recognizes features regardless of their position in the image.

### Types of Pooling Layers

#### (A) Max Pooling (Most Common)
- **Functionality:** Selects the maximum value from each window (region) of the feature map.
- **Purpose:** Retains the most important feature (strongest activation) while reducing size.

##### Example with a 2×2 filter and stride = 2:
###### Input Feature Map (4×4)
```
1   3   2   1  
4   6   5   7  
8   9   4   2  
3   5   1   0  
```
###### Max Pooling (2×2 filter)
```
6   7  
9   5  
```
- **Pros:** Preserves strong features and reduces computation.
- **Cons:** Ignores other activations, which may lose some information.

#### (B) Average Pooling
- **Functionality:** Takes the average value from each region of the feature map.

##### Example with a 2×2 filter and stride = 2:
###### Input Feature Map (4×4)
```
1   3   2   1  
4   6   5   7  
8   9   4   2  
3   5   1   0  
```
###### Average Pooling (2×2 filter)
```
3.5   3.75  
6.25  2.75  
```
- **Pros:** Retains more information about feature distribution.
- **Cons:** Less effective at filtering noise than Max Pooling.

#### (C) Global Pooling (Global Max/Average Pooling)
- **Functionality:** Reduces the entire feature map to a single value.
- **Usage:** Applied before fully connected layers to reduce parameters.
- **Example:** If the input feature map is 8×8, Global Max Pooling will take the maximum value from the entire 8×8 map and return a single value.
- **Commonly used in:** CNN architectures like ResNet and MobileNet.

### Key Pooling Parameters
| Parameter  | Description  |
|------------|-------------|
| **Pool Size** | Defines the window size (e.g., 2×2 or 3×3) |
| **Stride** | Defines how far the window moves (e.g., stride = 2 means it moves 2 pixels at a time) |
| **Padding** | "Same" (keeps size same) or "Valid" (shrinks size) |

---

## Activation Layer
### Purpose:
An activation layer applies a non-linear transformation to the input, helping the neural network learn complex patterns. Without activation functions, a neural network behaves like a simple linear regression model.

### Types of Activation Functions

#### **ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit)**
- **Most commonly used in CNNs**.
- **Function:** Replaces negative values with zero.
- **Formula:** \[ f(x) = \max(0, x) \]
- **Benefit:** Helps solve the vanishing gradient problem.
- **Usage:**
```python
layers.Activation('relu')
```

#### **Sigmoid**
- **Used for binary classification tasks**.
- **Function:** Maps values between 0 and 1.
- **Formula:** \[ f(x) = \frac{1}{1 + e^{-x}} \]
- **Usage:**
```python
layers.Activation('sigmoid')
```

#### **Tanh (Hyperbolic Tangent)**
- **Similar to Sigmoid but maps values between -1 and 1**.
- **Function:** Used in some cases to center data around zero.
- **Formula:** \[ f(x) = \frac{e^x - e^{-x}}{e^x + e^{-x}} \]
- **Usage:**
```python
layers.Activation('tanh')
```

#### **Softmax**
- **Used for multi-class classification problems**.
- **Function:** Converts logits into probabilities that sum to 1.
- **Usage:**
```python
layers.Activation('softmax')
```

## 2. Batch Normalization Layer

### Purpose:
Batch Normalization (BatchNorm) normalizes activations across mini-batches to speed up training and improve stability.

### Benefits:
✔ Normalizes input to each layer (mean ≈ 0, variance ≈ 1).
✔ Helps reduce internal covariate shift.
✔ Allows for higher learning rates, reducing training time.
✔ Acts as a regularizer, reducing the need for Dropout.

### How Batch Normalization Works:
1. Computes the mean and variance of activations in a batch.
2. Normalizes the activations:
   \[ x_{normalized} = \frac{x - \mu}{\sigma} \]
3. Applies a learnable scale (γ) and shift (β):
   \[ y = \gamma x_{normalized} + \beta \]

### BatchNorm in Keras:
```python
from tensorflow.keras import layers
layers.BatchNormalization()
```

---

## 3. Dropout Layer

### Purpose:
Dropout randomly drops neurons during training to reduce overfitting.

### How It Works:
- During training, randomly sets a fraction of activations to zero.
- This forces the network to not rely on specific neurons, making it more robust.
- During inference (testing), all neurons are used.

### Dropout in Keras:
```python
layers.Dropout(rate=0.5)  # 50% neurons randomly dropped
```

### Benefits:
✔ Reduces overfitting.
✔ Helps the network generalize better to unseen data.
✔ Often used in fully connected (Dense) layers.

---

## 4. Flatten Layer

### Purpose:
The Flatten layer converts a multi-dimensional feature map into a 1D vector, preparing it for the fully connected (Dense) layer.

### Example:
- Input feature map: \(7 \times 7 \times 64\) (7x7 image with 64 channels)
- Flattened to \(1 \times 3136\) \((7 \times 7 \times 64 = 3136)\)

### Flatten in Keras:
```python
layers.Flatten()
```

---

## 5. Fully Connected (FC) Layer / Dense Layer

### Purpose:
A Fully Connected (FC) Layer, also called a Dense Layer in Keras, is a layer where every neuron is connected to every neuron in the next layer. It is commonly used in the final stages of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) or as a key component in traditional Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs).

### How It Works:
Each neuron in a Dense layer receives input from all neurons in the previous layer and produces an output for all neurons in the next layer.
It is mathematically equivalent to a matrix multiplication followed by an activation function:
\[ y = W \cdot x + b \]

Where:
- \( x \) = Input vector (flattened features from previous layers)
- \( W \) = Weight matrix (learnable parameters)
- \( b \) = Bias vector
- \( y \) = Output vector (activations)

Each neuron performs:
\[ z = \sum (w_i \cdot x_i) + b \]
Then, an activation function (like ReLU, Sigmoid, or Softmax) is applied to introduce non-linearity.

### Use Cases:
✅ In Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) → Converts extracted features into final predictions.
✅ In Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) → Used in classification, regression, and reinforcement learning tasks.
✅ In Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) → Used after LSTM/GRU layers for sequence tasks.

### Fully Connected Layer in Keras:
```python
from tensorflow.keras import layers

# Fully Connected Layer with 128 neurons and ReLU activation
layers.Dense(128, activation='relu')
```

---

## Regularization Techniques
Regularization techniques help prevent overfitting by adding constraints to the model’s parameters, ensuring better generalization to unseen data. TensorFlow provides built-in regularizers that can be applied to convolutional and dense layers.

### 1. L1 and L2 Regularization (Weight Decay)
These regularizers work by adding a penalty term to the loss function.

#### (i) L1 Regularization (Lasso)
- Adds the absolute values of the weights (|w|) to the loss function.
- Encourages sparsity, meaning some weights become zero, reducing model complexity.
- Formula:
  \[ L1\_Loss = \lambda \sum |w| \]

#### (ii) L2 Regularization (Ridge)
- Adds the squared magnitude of weights (w²) to the loss function.
- Encourages small, non-zero weights, preventing overfitting.
- Formula:
  \[ L2\_Loss = \lambda \sum w^2 \]

#### (iii) L1 + L2 (Elastic Net)
- Combines both L1 and L2 regularization.
- Formula:
  \[ Loss = \lambda_1 \sum |w| + \lambda_2 \sum w^2 \]

### 2. Dropout Regularization
- Randomly drops units during training to reduce reliance on specific neurons, improving generalization.

### 3. Batch Normalization (Indirect Regularization)
- Normalizes activations to stabilize training and improve performance.

### 4. Data Augmentation (Indirect Regularization)
- Artificially increases the training data by applying transformations (e.g., rotation, flipping, cropping) to improve model robustness.

## Metrics in TensorFlow
Metrics help evaluate a model’s performance during training and validation.

### A. Classification Metrics
#### (i) Accuracy
- Measures the fraction of correctly classified images.
- Works well for balanced datasets.
- Usage: `metrics=['accuracy']`

#### (ii) Precision, Recall, and F1-Score

  \[ Precision = \frac{TP}{TP + FP} \]
- **Recall (Sensitivity)**: Measures how many actual positives were correctly predicted.
  \[ Recall = \frac{TP}{TP + FN} \]
- **F1-Score**: Harmonic mean of precision and recall, useful when data is imbalanced.
  \[ F1 = 2 \times \frac{Precision \times Recall}{Precision + Recall} \]

Implementation:

model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='mse', metrics=[MeanSquaredError()])
```

#### (ii) Mean Absolute Error (MAE)

model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='mae', metrics=[MeanAbsoluteError()])
```

#### (iii) R² Score (Coefficient of Determination)
- Measures how well the model explains the variance in the data.
- Formula:
  \[ R^2 = 1 - \frac{SS_{res}}{SS_{tot}} \]
```python
import tensorflow.keras.backend as K

def r2_score(y_true, y_pred):
    SS_res = K.sum(K.square(y_true - y_pred))
    SS_tot = K.sum(K.square(y_true - K.mean(y_true)))
    return 1 - SS_res / (SS_tot + K.epsilon())

model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='mse', metrics=[r2_score])
```

## 1. Callbacks in CNN Training
Callbacks are functions that help monitor and control the training process by saving models, stopping early, adjusting learning rates dynamically, and improving overall model efficiency.

### Key Callback Functions

#### 1. Early Stopping
- Stops training when the validation loss stops improving.
- Prevents overfitting and reduces unnecessary training time.

**Example (Keras):**
```python
from tensorflow.keras.callbacks import EarlyStopping

early_stopping = EarlyStopping(monitor='val_loss', patience=5, restore_best_weights=True)
```
- `monitor`: Metric to track (e.g., 'val_loss', 'accuracy').
- `patience`: Number of epochs to wait before stopping.
- `restore_best_weights`: Loads the best weights before stopping.

#### 2. Model Checkpoint
- Saves the model during training based on a chosen metric, ensuring that the best model is retained.

**Example (Keras):**
```python
from tensorflow.keras.callbacks import ModelCheckpoint

checkpoint = ModelCheckpoint('best_model.h5', monitor='val_loss', save_best_only=True)
```
- `filepath`: File path to save the model.
- `monitor`: Metric to track.
- `save_best_only`: Saves only when the model improves.

#### 3. Learning Rate Scheduler
- Dynamically adjusts the learning rate during training to improve convergence.

**Example (Keras):**
```python
from tensorflow.keras.callbacks import LearningRateScheduler

def lr_schedule(epoch):
    return 0.001 * (0.1 ** (epoch // 10))

lr_scheduler = LearningRateScheduler(lr_schedule)
```
**Strategies:**
- **Step Decay:** Reduce the learning rate at fixed intervals.
- **Exponential Decay:** Gradually decrease the learning rate.
- **ReduceLROnPlateau:** Reduce learning rate when validation performance plateaus.

#### 4. ReduceLROnPlateau
- Reduces the learning rate when a monitored metric stops improving.

**Example (Keras):**
```python
from tensorflow.keras.callbacks import ReduceLROnPlateau

reduce_lr = ReduceLROnPlateau(monitor='val_loss', factor=0.5, patience=3, min_lr=1e-6)
```
- `factor`: Reduction factor for the learning rate.
- `patience`: Number of epochs to wait before reducing the learning rate.
- `min_lr`: Minimum allowable learning rate.

#### 5. TensorBoard Callback
- Provides visualizations for loss, accuracy, and other metrics.

**Example (Keras):**
```python
from tensorflow.keras.callbacks import TensorBoard

tensorboard = TensorBoard(log_dir='logs', histogram_freq=1)
```
- `log_dir`: Directory where logs are stored.
- `histogram_freq`: Frequency of logging weight histograms.

#### 6. Custom Callbacks
- Allows implementing custom logic during training.

**Example (Keras):**
```python
from tensorflow.keras.callbacks import Callback

class CustomCallback(Callback):
    def on_epoch_end(self, epoch, logs=None):
        print(f"Epoch {epoch + 1}: Loss = {logs['loss']}")

custom_callback = CustomCallback()
```

### How to Use Callbacks in Model Training
```python
model.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=50, validation_data=(X_val, y_val),
          callbacks=[early_stopping, checkpoint, reduce_lr, tensorboard])
```

## 2. Transfer Learning in CNNs
Transfer learning is a technique where a pre-trained model, trained on a large dataset, is adapted to a different but related task. It reduces training time, requires less data, and improves accuracy.

### Benefits of Transfer Learning
✅ Faster training (avoids training from scratch).  
✅ Works well with small datasets.  
✅ Improves model performance by leveraging pre-learned features.  
✅ Reduces computation cost.  

❌ Might not work for very different datasets.  
❌ Fine-tuning requires careful learning rate tuning.  
❌ Large pre-trained models require high memory (GPU recommended).  

### Types of Transfer Learning
#### A. Feature Extraction
- Uses a pre-trained CNN as a feature extractor by removing the fully connected layers.
- The extracted features are passed through a new classifier.

**Example:**
- Take a pre-trained VGG16 or ResNet, remove the top layer, and add a new classifier for the new task.

**When to Use?**
- When the dataset is small.
- When the new task is similar to the original dataset.

#### B. Fine-Tuning
- Some layers of the pre-trained CNN are "unfrozen" and retrained along with the new classifier.
- A lower learning rate is used to adjust existing weights.

**When to Use?**
- When the new dataset is large enough.
- When the new dataset is significantly different from the original dataset.

### Steps for Applying Transfer Learning
#### Step 1: Choose a Pre-Trained Model
Popular pre-trained models include:
- **VGG16/VGG19** - Simple architecture, deep layers.
- **ResNet** - Good for deep networks.
- **Inception** - Efficient and accurate.
- **MobileNet** - Optimized for mobile and embedded systems.
- **EfficientNet** - Balances efficiency and accuracy.

#### Step 2: Load the Pre-Trained Model
```python
from tensorflow.keras.applications import VGG16

```
- `weights='imagenet'`: Uses pre-trained ImageNet weights.
- `include_top=False`: Removes the fully connected layers.
- `input_shape=(224, 224, 3)`: Defines input image size.

#### Step 3: Feature Extraction (Freeze Pre-Trained Layers)
```python
for layer in base_model.layers:
    layer.trainable = False  # Freeze the layers
```

#### Step 4: Add a New Classifier
```python
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Flatten, Dense, Dropout
from tensorflow.keras.models import Sequential

model = Sequential([
    base_model,
    Flatten(),
    Dense(256, activation='relu'),
    Dropout(0.5),
    Dense(10, activation='softmax')
])
```

#### Step 5: Compile and Train the Model
```python
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='categorical_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])
model.fit(train_data, validation_data=val_data, epochs=10)
```

#### Step 6: Fine-Tuning (Optional)
```python
for layer in base_model.layers[-10:]:  # Unfreeze last 10 layers
    layer.trainable = True

from tensorflow.keras.optimizers import Adam
model.compile(optimizer=Adam(learning_rate=0.0001), loss='categorical_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])
model.fit(train_data, validation_data=val_data, epochs=5)
```

## 4. Steps to Use Transfer Learning
### Step 1: Load a Pre-Trained Model
```python
base_model = EfficientNetB4(weights='imagenet', include_top=False, input_shape=(380, 380, 3))
```
### Step 2: Freeze Pre-Trained Layers
```python
for layer in base_model.layers:
    layer.trainable = False
```
### Step 3: Add a Custom Classifier
```python
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Flatten, Dense, Dropout
from tensorflow.keras.models import Sequential

model = Sequential([
    base_model,
    Flatten(),
    Dense(256, activation='relu'),
    Dropout(0.5),
    Dense(10, activation='softmax')
])
```
### Step 4: Compile and Train the Model
```python
from tensorflow.keras.optimizers import Adam

model.compile(optimizer=Adam(learning_rate=0.0001), loss='categorical_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])
model.fit(train_data, validation_data=val_data, epochs=10)
```
