üîß Other techniques:
- `L1`: Adds absolute values of weights
- `Elastic Net`: Combines L1 and L2
- `Dropout` and `BatchNormalization` also serve as regularization

---

### 9Ô∏è‚É£ Evaluation Metrics

```python
from tensorflow.keras.metrics import CategoricalAccuracy, TopKCategoricalAccuracy

- `CategoricalAccuracy`: Measures if predicted label = true label
- `TopKCategoricalAccuracy`: Checks if the correct class is within top-K predictions

üéØ Other useful metrics:
- `Precision`, `Recall`, `AUC`
- `Sparse` versions for non-one-hot labels

---

### üîÅ Callbacks ‚Äî Dynamic Training Control

```python
from tensorflow.keras.callbacks import ModelCheckpoint, EarlyStopping, ReduceLROnPlateau
```

- `ModelCheckpoint`: Saves model weights at best performance (e.g., lowest val_loss)
- `EarlyStopping`: Stops training if validation performance plateaus
- `ReduceLROnPlateau`: Automatically reduces learning rate on plateaus

üö¶ Useful options:
- `patience`: Number of epochs to wait before triggering
- `restore_best_weights=True`: Reverts to the best model

---
