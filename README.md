# ***Project Overview***
Hello! Welcome to my  ***Emotion Recognition Project***.  I'm excited to share my experiences on how I developed a deep learning model. I trained a CNN model with images and experimented with different layers and hyperparameters. I utilized data augmentation and transfer learning. 

Throughout the project, I made four models in total from various datasets, using new approaches each time. I started learning all this from scratch, including deep learning, CNNs, data augmentation, transfer learning, and machine learning.  

Here, within this repository, I will place all my project results, my working procedure, my GUI, etc. Hope the resource would be useful to others as well. Also, within the "Basic" folder, I will store all my notes.
