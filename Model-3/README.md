
# Emotion Recognition Using Facial Expressions For psychotherapy

## 📖 Description  
This project combines **deep learning-based facial emotion recognition** with **ancient Hindu scriptural wisdom** to provide a unique, spiritually uplifting user experience.  

A **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** detects the user's emotion from their facial expressions via a live camera feed or uploaded image. Based on the detected emotion (e.g., happiness, sadness, anger), the system displays a relevant **motivational quote, shloka (verse), or teaching** from sacred texts like the **Bhagavad Gita, Ramayana, Mahabharata, and Vedas**.

## ✨ Features  
✔ **Real-time emotion detection** (7 basic emotions: Happy, Sad, Angry, Surprise, Fear, Disgust, Neutral)  
✔ **GUI interface** for easy interaction (camera feed + emotion display)  
✔ **Scriptural wisdom integration** – Dynamically fetched responses from a JSON database  
✔ **Multi-input support** – Works with live webcam or uploaded images  
✔ **Progressively improved CNN models** for higher accuracy

## 🛠 Technologies Used  
- **Deep Learning**:  
  - TensorFlow/Keras (CNN implementation)  
  - OpenCV (Real-time face detection)  
- **GUI**:  
  - Tkinter (Python’s standard GUI toolkit)  
- **Data Handling**:  
  - JSON (Storing and retrieving scriptural responses)  
  - NumPy, Pandas (Data processing)  
- **Dataset**:  
  - FER-2013 (Facial Emotion Recognition dataset)

## 📈 Model Evolution: From Basic to Advanced  
### **Model 1: Basic CNN**  
- Simple 3-layer architecture (Conv2D → MaxPooling → Dense)  
- Low accuracy (~60%) due to underfitting  

### **Model 2: Deeper CNN with Regularization**  
- Added **Batch Normalization** and **Dropout** layers to prevent overfitting  
- Increased depth (5 Conv layers)  
- Accuracy improved to ~75%  

### **Model 3: Optimized CNN with Data Augmentation**  
- Used **ImageDataGenerator** for real-time augmentation (rotation, zoom, flip)  
- Added **Early Stopping** and **Learning Rate Scheduling**  
- Final test accuracy: **~85%**

## 📂 Dataset  
Trained on the **FER-2013 dataset** (48x48 grayscale images of faces labeled with 7 emotions):  
- **35,887 images** (Training + Validation)  
- **3,589 test images**  

*(Dataset available on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/msambare/fer2013))*

## 📜 How Scriptural Responses Work  
- A **JSON file** (`responses.json`) stores categorized responses:  
  ```json
  {
    "happy": ["Bhagavad Gita 2.14: 'The wise are not disturbed...'", ...],
    "sad": ["Ramayana 3.45: 'After hardship comes relief...'", ...],
    "angry": ["Mahabharata 5.39: 'Anger leads to clouded judgment...'", ...]
  }
  ```
- The GUI **randomly selects** a response matching the detected emotion.  

*(Example: If "sad" is detected, a comforting shloka appears.)*

## 🚀 How to Run Locally  

### **Prerequisites**  
- Python 3.8+  
- pip (Python package manager)  

### **Installation**  
1. Clone the repo:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/emotion-recognition-scriptural.git
   cd emotion-recognition-scriptural
   ```
2. Install dependencies:  
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Run the GUI:  
   ```bash
   python main_gui.py
   ```

### **Usage**  
- Click **"Start Camera"** for real-time emotion detection.  
- Use **"Upload Image"** to test on a static image.  
- Detected emotion + scriptural response will display automatically.

## 🔮 Future Improvements  
- [ ] **Add more emotions** (e.g., contempt, pride)  
- [ ] **Multi-language support** (Sanskrit + English translations)  
- [ ] **Mobile app integration** (Using TensorFlow Lite)  
- [ ] **User customization** (Let users add their own quotes)
